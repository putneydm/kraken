# Crackin

Every time I start a project, I find myself starting from scratch. I wanted to make a build system for myself that I could just fork and get started when I had a new project. This is a very specific build system for me, but if you want to use it, feel free. 

It uses SASS, Markdown and Gulp to build out components for web site development.

Only a small portion of Crackin is orginal work by me. It mainly pulls together work that many other people have done into one place. 

* Huge credit goes to [Chris Fernandi's](http://gomakethings.com/) [Kraken](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kraken) (hence my name for this) as it provided the bones of this project, many of its basic ideas and much of the gulpfile is adapted from his work. 
* HTML 5 boilerplate.
* Bourbon, the best SASS mixin system.
* SASS mixins of my own design.
