<p>Alicia Munnell has never been one <strong>to sugarcoat</strong> her opinions. As a top economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 1991, she shook up the New England banking industry by documenting discriminatory lending practices.</p>
<p>As an official in the Clinton administration, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/11/30/tracing-lives-shaped-busing-boston/vxviumhRVnWtgm1b8hcfqJ/story.html">she opposed</a> the balanced-budget amendment because it would cut Social Security and defense spending. And as a researcher, she warned that government insurance designed to protect workers and their pension plans wasnâ€™t adequate to cover funding shortfalls faced by struggling companies.</p>
